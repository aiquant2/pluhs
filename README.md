# plu-hs README

Welcome to the **plu-hs** extension! This extension provides syntax highlighting, semantic highlighting, and other developer tools for **Plutus** and **Haskell** languages, with seamless integration with the **Cardano Node** for smart contract development.

## Features

- **Syntax highlighting** for both Haskell and Plutus code.
- **Semantic highlighting** to distinguish different code elements such as functions, variables, and Plutus-specific constructs (e.g., `Validator`, `Datum`, `Redeemer`).
- **Bracket matching** and auto-closing pairs for common Plutus and Haskell structures.
- Support for **Plutus-specific** keywords and tokens like `TxOut`, `TxIn`, `UTxO`, `PubKeyHash`.
- Integration with **VS Code** for enhanced productivity when writing smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain.

> **Tip:** Use animations or short, focused videos to demonstrate the extensionâ€™s features. This helps users understand it better and shows off the real-time performance of the tool.

## Requirements

Before using the **plu-hs** extension, ensure that you have the following installed:

- **VS Code** version 1.94.0 or later.
- **Haskell** installed on your system (via `ghcup` or similar).
- **Cardano Node** running locally or connected to a testnet for full Plutus smart contract integration.
  
To install and set up the Cardano node, follow the official [Cardano Node installation guide](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/get-started/installing-cardano-node/).

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `plu-hs.enable`: Enable or disable this extension.
* `plu-hs.autoClosePairs`: Enable or disable automatic closing of pairs for Haskell and Plutus.
* `plu-hs.semanticHighlighting`: Enable or disable semantic token highlighting.

## Known Issues

Please be aware of the following known issues:

- **High memory usage** when working with very large Plutus contracts.
- **Semantic highlighting delays** may occur on first load for complex projects.

If you encounter issues, please feel free to report them on our GitHub repository.
